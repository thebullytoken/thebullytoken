BULLY is a community driven crypto project designed to empower our
community to drive change and influence the lives of children around the
planet! Whether you’ve been bullied before, or even been a bully yourself, BULLY
token gives everyone a chance to shape the future for generations to come
thanks to its HUGE 3% distribution to our charity wallet.

The goal for BULLY is to partner with amazing charities around the world who
specialise in helping kids who have suffered from immense bullying and have a
strong focus for educational programs delivered in school and online to teach
kids new skills and empowerment to better deal with bullies in their lives. The
BULLY community will not stop until the notion of bullying is supressed globally
and we can be confident it has been defeated once and for all.

The success of BULLY will largely be determined by the strength and support of
its community. All holders of the token will be rewarded with a portion of its 3%
redistribution tokenomics. But as powerful and necessary as HODL is, spreading
the word to everyone you know about BULLY and its ambitious goal to
suppressing bullying globally is a never-ending commitment for all holders.
Remember every single time someone transacts with the BULLY token, 3% will
be sent to our charity wallet, fast tracking our ability to partner and donate with
some amazing charities.

There are so many weird and wonderful crypto projects out there, but none have
a more compelling reason to support and share the word like BULLY. Whether
you’re a relative newbie in the crypto world or a seasoned trader BULLY
welcomes all holders and thanks you in advance for your commitment to
spreading the word and fast tracking our battle on bullying! Let’s kick bullying
to the moon!!!
